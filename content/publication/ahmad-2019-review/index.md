There is a continued interest in understanding peopleâ€™s interest through the contents they share online. However, the data
generated is massive, characterized by textual jargons and tokens that contain no sentiment or opinion value. One way of
reducing the data dimension and pruning of irrelevant features is feature selection. However, the existing approaches of
feature selection are still inefficient. Two prominent feature selection methods in sentiment analysis are information gain
and ontology-based methods. Information gain has the disadvantage of not considering redundancy between features
while ontology-based approach requires a lot of human intervention. The aim of this paper is to review these two
methods. The review of these two methods shows that using the two methods in a two-step approach can overcome their
limitations and provide an optimal feature set for sentiment analysis.
